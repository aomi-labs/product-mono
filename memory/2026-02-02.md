- Diagnosed Discord /connect not showing bound wallet: command never queried DB or followed up after binding.
- Updated Discord /connect to check existing wallet and to post a follow-up confirmation with the connected address once binding appears in DB.
- Improved mini-app connect UX with clearer "linking" state and a full/short address display after success, plus Discord-specific guidance.
