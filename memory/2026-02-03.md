- Added SessionManager::get_session_config and used bound wallet + current namespace when creating Telegram sessions.
- Implemented Telegram /namespace and /model (rig-only) commands with DM-only gating plus help/parse updates.
- Reused bound wallet lookup in Telegram message flow to sync UserState without extra DB calls.
- Updated Telegram /namespace and /model to show current selection plus other available choices when called without args, and removed "rig" wording in user-facing messages.
- Fixed user namespace loading for Postgres by casting users.namespaces to text for Any driver decoding.
- Removed wallet_challenges/user_wallets usage: mini-app now binds wallet by upserting users+sessions, and wallet service no longer reads those tables.
- Mini-app wallet bind now sends a Telegram confirmation message after successful binding.
