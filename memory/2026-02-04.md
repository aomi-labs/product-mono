- Added x to default namespace set and default user namespaces, and set X tools to namespace "x" so they can be authorized/used directly.
- Fixed X tool client initialization to lazily create the client when first used, and made TwitterAPI responses more tolerant (status/code parsing and flexible number/string decoding).
- Fixed serde bound error in X API response wrapper by removing default on generic data field.
