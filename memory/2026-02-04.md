- Updated deploy workflow to disable xtrace, mask API keys, replace backend stop/rm with compose down, and add a retrying health check loop.
- Enforced required POSTGRES_PASSWORD in docker/setup-db.sh and removed password echo.
- Unable to create git commits because the worktree git dir is outside the sandbox (/root/clawd/...), so git index locks cannot be created.
