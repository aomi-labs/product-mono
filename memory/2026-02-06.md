## Telegram AA one-click signing
- Added Telegram-side AA wallet secret storage helper in `/Users/han/github/product-mono/aomi/bin/telegram/src/aa_wallet.rs`.
- Wired AA wallet creation to persist private key for the DM session.
- Added in-chat `Approve & Sign` / `Reject` callbacks for wallet transaction requests when the connected wallet is the in-chat AA wallet.
- Implemented one-click transaction signing + broadcast using `alloy` provider/wallet flow, with chain-aware RPC resolution from `aomi-anvil` provider manager.
- Added callback response events (`wallet_tx_response`) back into session state and pending-tx cleanup.
- Kept mini-app signing fallback for non-AA wallet sessions.
- Safety: AA one-click signing now refuses to send if no RPC endpoint is configured for the requested chain id (no cross-chain fallback).
- Switched AA wallet creation to local-device generation via Telegram WebApp (`/create-wallet`), no private key storage on backend.
- Added Telegram wallet-create module `/Users/han/github/product-mono/aomi/bin/telegram/src/wallet_create.rs` and removed server-side keypair creation path from commands.
- Removed Telegram one-click server-side AA signing path that depended on backend key storage; wallet tx signing now uses mini-app flow.
- Fixed duplicate Telegram wallet confirmation spam: `/Users/han/github/product-mono/mini-app/src/app/api/wallet/bind/route.ts` now sends `✅ Wallet connected` only when the bound wallet for the session actually changes, preventing duplicate messages from repeated bind calls.
