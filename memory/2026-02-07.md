Refactored Telegram bot command/panel flow, added API key handling and thread-aware session keys, and wired status panel to backend user_state via /api/state.
Added /apikey <key> direct input alongside ForceReply prompt.
Fixed double ForceReply send for /apikey prompt.
Moved mini-app configuration to bot.toml (mini_app_url) and removed env usage.
Cached panel keyboards in panel structs to avoid reinitialization on each render.
ApiKeyPanel now owns prompt text; router exposes it for reply detection.
Removed DbWalletConnectService; PanelCtx now implements WalletConnectService directly.
Removed keyboard helper functions and inlined keyboard builds in panel constructors.
Backend URL now only reads from bot.toml (no AOMI_BACKEND_URL fallback).
Made mini_app_url required (no Option) and removed optional handling in panels/handlers.
Replaced make_sign_keyboard with SignPanel in panels/sign.rs.
Moved pending-tx creation into SignPanel and removed /sign command path.
SignPanel now owns the transaction prompt template.
